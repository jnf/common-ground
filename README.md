# Common Ground

This started, more or less, with an icebreaker game played during a workshop. The facilitator would make a statement like _I share common ground with anyone who like cats._, and folks who positively identified with that statement--_yes, I like cats too_--would stand up or otherwise signal their agreement.

The goal was to illustrate commonality, that we're much more alike than we are different. The facilitator opened the next statement to a volunteer in the audience. _I share common ground with those who prefer dogs_, and _I share common ground with those who love cats and dogs_ came quickly and people began to engage with the game.

The facilitator seized upon the moment with _I share common ground with anyone who has a loved one that is currently incarcerated_. It was a sombering statement, and its impact was plain to see. After a moment, a few people indicated that they, too, had a loved one behind bars. It brought us, a group of strangers, closer together, and made it safe to be vulnerable and curious. All because we knew we shared common ground with the folks around us.

The repository is an exploration of using web sockets to play Common Ground with a larger audience, like during a conference presentation.
